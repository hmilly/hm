        <p>
          I'm an enthusiastic and skilled <span>web developer</span> who also
          possesses a wealth of transferable skills and a passion for digital
          innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been interested in web design since myspace was around, but
          have only taken to studying web development seriously in the last few
          years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've mainly been working with <span>React</span>, but I'm open to so
          much more! Iâ€™m currently seeking my first commercial role within
          frontend development.
        </p>
