          <p>
            I'm an enthusiastic and skilled frontend developer who
            also possesses a wealth of transferable skills and a passion for
            digital innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been interested in web design since myspace was around, but
            have only taken to studying frontend development seriously in the
            last few years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've mainly been working with React, but I'm open to so
            much more! Iâ€™m currently seeking my first commercial role within
            frontend development, and am open to remote UK positions or
            hybrid office-based opportunities within the Greater London area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please feel free to view my projects and github page, or if you know
            of any job openings, please reach out on LinkedIn!
